> ### Data Scientist

The purpose of this site is to share my analyses that I think are interesting. I'll share my code and outline my reasoning for the steps I've taken. I hope that by sharing these online, others will find something useful or interesting here.

I am a student in the Master of Statistics programme at the KU Leuven in Belgium. Prior to that I was a Senior Data Analyst at Glass, Lewis & Co. I earned my BS in Finance at California State University, Northridge. My interests include data science, machine learning, statistics, video games, nature, diving and travel. I'm from Santa Barbara, California.
