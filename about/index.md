> ### Data Scientist

I am a student in the Master of Statistics programme at the KU Leuven in Belgium. Prior to that I was a Senior Data Analyst at Glass, Lewis & Co. I earned my BS in Finance at California State University, Northridge. My interests include data science, machine learning, statistics, video games, nature, diving and travel.
