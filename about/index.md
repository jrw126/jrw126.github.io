> ### Data analyst

This site is a home for my analyses, visualizations and the occasional rant. I hope that by sharing my analyses and code online, others will find something interesting or useful.

I am a student in the Master of Statistics programme at KU Leuven in Belgium. Prior to that I was a Senior Data Analyst at Glass, Lewis & Co. I earned my BS in Finance at California State University, Northridge. My interests include data science, machine learning, statistics, games, nature, diving and travel. I'm from Santa Barbara, California.
